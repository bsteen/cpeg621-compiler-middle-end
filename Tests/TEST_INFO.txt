This file gives details on which variables to pay attention to (especially for 
phi insertion) in a given test file after it is sent through the compiler middle
end. I tried to make sure phis were inserted only when necessary and with the
fewest amount of arguments necessary.

To run, do: ./calc Tests/<file_name>
Then look at Output/tac-ssa.txt for the compiler middle end output in SSA form
with basic blocks

All other test files not explicitly mentioned here will also have correct phis, 
but in most cases are just combinations or repeats of the files listed here

********************************************************************************
class_example.txt
	Provided example from assignment sheet (single 1-deep if else)

correct_phi3.txt
	Chained by phi writes

correct_phi5.txt
	y assigned in nested if only and then read after nest
	x assigned in nested if/else and read after nest
	x assigned in outer if after nest and outer else, read outside

correct_phi6.txt
	x assigned a value inside an inner if and assigned in both outer if/else
	y assigned in both nested if/else and then read after nest and outside
	
correct_phi7.txt
	Case where assigned value before nested if and only in inner if => only need
	outer if arg and nested if args as phi args (var x)
	
correct_phi8.txt
	z defined prior to if else then defined in both inner if and else, 
	then read from outside, then written to at end of outer if
	also written to in outer else and then read outside
	(phi correctly only needed last outer if and outer else value, ignores
	all others)
	
correct_phi9.txt
	x written in both inner if else, not read until fully outside

correct_phi10.txt
	x written in inner if read right after then read outside

correct_phi11.txt
	x written in inner if and then read outside entire if/else
	y written in both inner if/else, written in outer if then read outside
	entire if/else

ifelse2.txt
	y being reading inside nested if when it was already defined in outer if
	and in previous if/else
